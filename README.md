### Hi! 👋 

I'm Maggie Satterfield! I'm currently a  software engineer passionate about challenging myself in this field and
sharing knowledge with my peers. I earned my bachelor's degree from the University of Georgia in Forest Resources and 
took the path to become a Geographic Information Systems (GIS) specialist. After 6 years, I've progressed from self-taught
programmer to software engineer.

Primary language: *Python* 🐍  
Other great skills: Communicating technical concepts, troubleshooting, writing technical docs  
What's important to me: Readable code, documentation, best practices

1. Automating spatial data creation workflows for the Bureau of Ocean and Energy Management (BOEM)
2. Deriving bathhymetric data along the coast of Hawaii using satellite imagery and Machine Learning
3. Tutoring graduate students in their GIS spatial analysis classes

**📚 I'm currently learning...**
1. Machine learning foundations, processes, and algorithms
2. JavaScript
3. Cloud patforms (AWS)

**🌱 I'm interested in...**
1. Earth and space sciences
2. Backend software engineering
3. Always getting back to basics >>> data structures and algorithms
